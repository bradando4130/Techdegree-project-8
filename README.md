# Techdegree-project-8


Employee Directory Fetch API project

A project that was part of my Treehouse Techdegree. 

We were tasked with using JavsScript to request and display information on screen using a 3rd party API. 
This API would randomly generate mock user data which would be displayed on the page, and could be filtered through

Made using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
